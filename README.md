# micropsi-task

## Summary
This is my implementation of a coding task that I received when I was applying to a job on December, 2022.

## Description
Please implement a Python module, which can be installed using pip**, including tests, with the following functionality: Given an array of elements that provide a less than operator, find the minimum using as few comparisons as possible. The array shall be given such that the first elements are strictly monotonically decreasing, the remaining elements are strictly monotonically increasing. The less than operator be defined as the operator that works on such vectors where a < b if min(a,b) == a.
